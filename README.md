# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
This project is done as part of the requirement for the course "Data Analytics with Python" at ReDI School of Digital Integration.

The objective of this project was to predict the price of staying at Air bnb in New York city by using machine learning. Two alogorithms are applied for the analysis: linear regression and random forest. 

Firstly, linear regression was applied. P-values of most of the predictor variables were found as more than 0.05. So, null hypothesis couldn't be rejected. It means it is very unlikely to get a change of the dependent variable price with the change of independent vaiables.
After that, a decision was made to apply random forest algorithm to get a model to predict price of staying at Air bnb. Random forest algorithm is more capable to explain the complex relationship between variables. 

Lastly, the distribition of price is plotted and analyzed on the maps.
